#! 1.2.6 STRUCTURED vs UNSTRUCTURED DATA
# in order to process, store, and analyze all of these different types of data,
# it is important to think about whether they are structured data or unstructured
# data.

#* strucuted data:
# structured data makes up about 10%-20% of generated data has clearly defined data types
# and patterns that make them easily to search and analyze. sources of structured data
# include sales records, airline reservation systems, and inventory control, structured
# data is usually stored in relational databases such as structured query language (sql)
# databases or in spreadsheets such as microsoft excel.


#* unstructured data:
# unstructured data makes up most data that is generated, about 80%, and cannot be organized
# into row and columns. this makes unstructured data difficult to search, manage, and analyze.
# sources of unstructured data include images, pdfs, sensor data, and social media posts,
# unstructured data is usually stored in a non-relational database also known as NoSQL database
