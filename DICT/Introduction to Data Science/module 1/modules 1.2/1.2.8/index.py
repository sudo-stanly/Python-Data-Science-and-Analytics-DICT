#! 1.2.8 SELECTING RELEVANT DATA
# selecting relevant data starts with defining the question that you want to answer.
# for example, suppose you are researching the factors that contribute to the overall
# wellness of the workforce. you can start by looking at the available data and determining
# which fields or measurements are relevant to your question. in the employee information table,
# repeated below, employment date has no impact on employee wellness therefore is irrelevant to
# the analysis. in contrast, overwork could impact employee wellness, and therefore, average
# weekly hours could be relevant to the search.
