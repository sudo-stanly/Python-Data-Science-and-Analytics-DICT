# all pieces of data have a feature called data type that tells applications
# how to treat it. operations performed are defined by the data type. identifying
# data types is helpful in analytics because we may need to group the data, sort
# the data, or run calculations on the data. data must be grouped by their given type to perform
# required operations. for example: consider the following data crunchers employee table.


# Each column (or field) in the Employee Information table has data that is all the same type. 
# The next table  describes the various data types. Read the descriptions for each data type. 
# Compare them to the data displayed in the Employee Information table and think about which 
# type each field is (For example, Job Title contains string data).
