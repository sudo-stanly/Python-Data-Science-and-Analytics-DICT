#! BAR CHARTS
# bar charts are similar to column charts, except, except the data is
# horizontally displayed. bar charts also allow for easy comparison
# between several data points. the data point labels on the horizontal
# bar chart are on the left side and are more readable when the label
# contains text rather than values.

#* use cases for bar charts:
#   - gross domestic product (GDP) of the 25 highest-grossing nations.
#   - the number of cars at a dealership sold by each sales representative.
#   - exam scores for each student in a math class.

#* best practices for bar charts:
#   - label the axes.

#   - consider ordering the bars so that the lengths go from longest
#     to shortest. the data type will most likely determine wheter the
#     longest bar should be on the bottom or the top to best illustrate
#     the intended pattern or trend.

#   - start the value of the x-axis at zero to accurately reflect the total
#     value of the bars.

#   - the spacing between bars should be roughly half the width of a bar.
