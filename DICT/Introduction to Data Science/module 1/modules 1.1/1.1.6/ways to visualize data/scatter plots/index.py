#! SCATTER PLOTS
# scatter plots are very popular for correlation visualizations or when
# you want toshow the distribution, or all possible values, of a large
# number of data points. scatter plots are also useful for demonstrating
# clustering or identifying outliers in the data. some use cases that illustrate
# visualizing the distribution of many data points with a scatter plot include:

#   - comparing countries' life expectencies to their GPSs (Gross Domestic Product)
#   - comparing the daily sales of ice cream to the average outside temperature across
#     multiple days.
#   - comparing the weight to the height of each person in a large group.

#* some best practices for scatter plots include:
#   - label your axes.
#   - make sure the data set is large enough to provide visualization for clustering
#     or outliers.
#   - start the value of the y-axis at zero to represent the data accurately. for
#     example, age ranges might be labeled on the x-axis.
#   - consider adding a trend line if a scatter plot shows a correlation between 
#     x- and y-axes.
#   - do not use more than two trend lines.
