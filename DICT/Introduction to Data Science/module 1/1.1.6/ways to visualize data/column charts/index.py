#! COLUMN CHARTS
# column charts are positioned vertically, as shown in the figure. they are
# probably the most common chart type used to display the numerical value of
# a specific data point and compare that value across similar categories.
# They allow for easy comparison among several data points.


#* Use cases for column charts:
#   - Revenue by country, as shown in the chart example.
#   - Last year's sales for the top four car companies in the US.
#   - Average student test scores for each of six math classes.

#* Best practices for column charts:
#   - Label the axes

#   - If the chart shows changes over time, plot the time increments
#     increments on the y-axis

#   - If time is not part of the data, consider ordering the column heights
#     to ascend or descend to demonstrate changes or trends.

#   - Keep the number of columns low, typically no more than 7, so the viewer
#     can see the value for each column.

#   - Start the value of the y-axis at zero to accurately reflect the column's
#     total value.

#   - The spacing between columns should be rougly half the width of a column.
