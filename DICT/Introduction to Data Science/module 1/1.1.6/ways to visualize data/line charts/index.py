#! LINE CHARTS
# line charts are one of the most commonly used charts for comparing
# two data sets. use line charts when the number of data points is high
# and you want to show a trend in the data over time.

#* Use cases for line charts:
#   - A company's quarterly sales for the past five years.
#   - The number of customers per week in the first year of a new
#     retail shop.
#   - Changes in a stock's price from opening to the closing bell.

#* Best practices for the line charts:
#   - Label the axes and the reference lines used to measure
#     the graph coordinates. It is common to plot time on the x-axis
#     (horizontal) and the data values on the y-axis(vertical).

#   - Use a solid line to connect the data points to illustrate trends.

#   - Keep the number of plotted lines to a minimum, typically no more than
#     5, so the chart does not become cluttered and difficult to read.

#   - Add a legend, a small visual representation of the chart's data, that
#     tells what each line represents to help your audience understand what
#     they are viewing.

#   - Always add a title.
