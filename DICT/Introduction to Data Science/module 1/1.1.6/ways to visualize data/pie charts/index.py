#! PIE CHARTS
# pie charts show parts of a whole. each slice, or segment, of
# the "pie", represents a percentage of the total number. the total
# sum of the segments must equal 100%. a pie chart displays the
# different values values of a given variable. some use cases that
# illustrate comparing the information with a pie chart include:

#   - annual expenses categories for a corporation (e,g. rent, administrative
#     utilities, production)
#   - a country's energy sources (e.g., oil, coal, gas, solar, wind)
#   - survey results for favorite type of movie (e.g., action, romance, comedy
#     drama, science fiction)

#* some best practices for pie charts include:
#   - keep the number of categories minimal so the viewer can differentiate
#     between segments. beyond ten segments, the slices begin to lose meaning
#     and impact. if necessary, consolidate smaller segments into one segment
#     with a label such as "other" or "miscellaneous".

#   - use a different color or darkness of grayscale for each segment.

#   - order the segments according to size.

#   - make sure the value of all segments equals to 100%.
