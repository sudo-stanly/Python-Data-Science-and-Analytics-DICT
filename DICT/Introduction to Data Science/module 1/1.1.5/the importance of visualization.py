#! IMPORTANCE of VISUALIZATION
# the data analysts at data crunchers work hard to create stories and reports from
# their clients' data. analysts rey heavily on visualization techniques to make the
# information relevant and actionable.
# visualizations are a way to display data in a manner that is easily understood. the
# most common ways to represent data visually are charts and graphs.

# there are many types of charts used to present information graphically. it is crucial
# to ensure that the type of visualization used best illusstrates the pattern, problem,
# or trend that needs highlighting; not all types of visualizations are appropriate for
# all kinds of data.


#! Factors to consider when choosing a visualization:
#  - The number of variables, which are the characteristics measured, that need are shown.
#  - The number of data points, or units of information, in each variable.
#  - Wheter the data  illustrates changes over time (hour, daily, weekly)
#  - The need to make a comparison or correlation between different data points

# often, analysts try a few different types of charts to choose one that provides the most
# effective view of the information.
